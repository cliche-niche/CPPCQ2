This directory contains four files other than README:

+ [Q.md](./Q.md): This file has the problem statement, a small sample input, corresponding output and an explanation of the answer.
+ [E.md](./E.md): This file is the editorial.
+ [main.cpp](./main.cpp): This file has code that generates an input and computes its corresponding output. It has two two different implementations, but one runs into T.L.E. It creates a `test.txt` file temporarily to store the input.
+ [ans.text](./ans.txt): This file has a random input in the beginning as mentioned in the problem statement, followed by corresponding output as described in the problem statement. There is some space between (specifically 3 newlines) the two. Different input can be generated by running [main.cpp](./main.cpp) but the file will be overwritten.
